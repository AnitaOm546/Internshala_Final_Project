# 🏎️ ABG Motors India Market Expansion Analysis

## 📅 Business Understanding

ABG Motors, a successful Japanese car manufacturer, is exploring an expansion into the Indian automotive market. The company has observed market growth and considers India to be quite similar to Japan in terms of consumer behavior. However, before finalizing the decision, the company aims to ensure that such a move would be profitable.
